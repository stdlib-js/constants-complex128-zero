    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Double-precision complex floating-point zero.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import COMPLEX128_ZERO from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/constants-complex128-zero@v0.2.3-deno/mod.js';
```

#### COMPLEX128_ZERO

Double-precision complex floating-point zero.

```javascript
import real from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64-real@deno/mod.js';
import imag from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64-imag@deno/mod.js';

var re = real( COMPLEX128_ZERO );
// returns 0.0

var im = imag( COMPLEX128_ZERO );
// returns 0.0
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import real from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64-real@deno/mod.js';
import imag from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64-imag@deno/mod.js';
import Complex128Array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-complex128@deno/mod.js';
import COMPLEX128_ZERO from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/constants-complex128-zero@v0.2.3-deno/mod.js';

var x = new Complex128Array( [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ] );
// returns <Complex128Array>

var v = x.get( 0 );
// returns <Complex128>

var re = real( v );
// returns 1.0

var im = imag( v );
// returns 2.0

x.fill( COMPLEX128_ZERO );

v = x.get( 0 );
// returns <Complex128>

re = real( v );
// returns 0.0

im = imag( v );
// returns 0.0
